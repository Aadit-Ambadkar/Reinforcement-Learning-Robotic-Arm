# Reinforcement-Learning-Robotic-Arm

Using the standard documentation from pyribs, and using their CMA-ME, I was able to generate the following accuracy rates for different positions of placing a robotic arm:

However, after more research, and edditing the cost function and algorithm, I was able to generate the following much better accuracy rates:

As can be seen, overall, the results are mostly the same, but in some areas (for example near the left), there is a high level of improvement (up to 50%).
